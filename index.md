# Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository use the Trove Harvester to download large quantities of digitised newspaper articles from Trove. There's also a few examples of how you can analyse and explore the harvested data.

The notebooks include:

* [**Trove Harvester web app**](newspaper_harvester_app.ipynb) — a simple web interface to the TroveHarvester, the easiest way to harvest data from Trove (runs in Appmode)
* [**Using TroveHarvester to get newspaper articles in bulk**](Using-TroveHarvester-to-get-newspaper-articles-in-bulk.ipynb) — an easy introduction to the TroveHarvester tool
* [**Exploring your TroveHarvester data**](Exploring-your-TroveHarvester-data.ipynb) — use Pandas to analyse your data and create some visualisations
* [**Explore harvested text files**](Explore-harvested-text-files.ipynb) — analyse the full text content of harvested articles

If you haven't used Jupyter notebooks before, you might want to try the Getting Started notebook. It introduces some basic concepts using data from the National Museum of Australia.
